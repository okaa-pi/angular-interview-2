# Angular Interview

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Backend

A REST service is available for your tests here:
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums (and /albums/xxx for a specific resource)
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users (and /users/xxx for a specific resource)
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos (and /photos?albumId=xxx for a specific album's photos)

# Issue to fix

My albums all display "Created by unknown" instead of the author's email.
Can you find out why? And fix it?


# I don't like Biz

According to our company policies, e-mail addresses that ends in .biz are suspicious.
How could I highlight the email address if it ends with '.biz' ?
